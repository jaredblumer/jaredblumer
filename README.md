# 👋 &nbsp;Hi, I'm Shy

Hi there! I'm Shy Blumer, a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with five years of experience building high-quality, test-driven web applications. I am a strong advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD), ensuring robust and reliable code in every project.

Before my career in software engineering, I worked as a Data Analyst and Database Administrator for various non-profit organizations. This background provided me with a solid foundation in data analysis and database management, enhancing my ability to create data-driven web applications.

## 🤔 &nbsp;My Philosophy
I'm a lifelong learner, driven by the principles of [Deep Work](https://todoist.com/inspiration/deep-work) and the [Growth Mindset](https://www.renaissance.com/edword/growth-mindset/). Inspired by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, I believe that "effort is what makes you smart or talented." This belief fuels my dedication to continuous improvement and tackling new challenges in the tech industry.
