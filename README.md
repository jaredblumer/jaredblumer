# üëã &nbsp;Hi, I'm Shy

With over five years of experience as a full-stack software engineer and data analyst, I have developed a versatile skill set that enables me to create reliable, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **Ruby on Rails**.

Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer at NextLink Labs, where I built and maintained full-stack web applications for clients using **Test-Driven Development** and **Object-Oriented Development** principles. I also contributed to continuous integration and deployment pipelines utilizing **AWS**, **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Jenkins**, and **Terraform**.

In my role as the Director of Data Analytics at the Eye & Ear Foundation of Pittsburgh, a University of Pittsburgh non-profit organization, I led significant initiatives that transformed our approach to fundraising and donor engagement. During my tenure with the organization, we raised a total of $**41.2 million** in donations with a team of only seven.

Beyond my professional career, I am deeply committed to community engagement and skill-sharing. As the founder of **Code & Coffee Pittsburgh**, I organize monthly events that provide a collaborative space for individuals at all levels of coding to practice their skills, network, and receive support. This initiative aims to foster an inclusive and supportive tech community.

Additionally, I founded the **Queery Coding Club**, focusing on creating a safe, inclusive environment for queer individuals, women, people of color, and people with disabilities in the technology space. This club is a testament to my belief in the power of diversity in driving innovation and creating equitable opportunities in the tech industry. Our events are tailored to the unique interests and needs of our attendees, offering a platform for learning, connecting, building, and collaborative growth.

## üíª &nbsp;Open-Source

Alongside my professional and community engagements, I am a **Volunteer Technical Contributor** at the **Wikimedia Foundation**. In this role, I work with the Quality and Testing Engineering Team to enhance testing coverage of the MediaWiki platform, notably used for Wikipedia and its related projects. My focus was on developing solutions that ensured robustness and reliability, underscoring my commitment to supporting open-source software and educational resources.

## ü§î &nbsp;My Philosophy
I'm a lifelong learner, driven by the principles of [Deep Work](https://todoist.com/inspiration/deep-work) and the [Growth Mindset](https://www.renaissance.com/edword/growth-mindset/). Inspired by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, I believe that **"Effort is what makes you smart or talented."** This belief fuels my dedication to continuous improvement and tackling new challenges in the tech industry.
